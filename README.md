# Dotfiles — Arch Linux + Hyprland + Stow

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for my Arch Linux environment running Hyprland — my first full ricing setup.  
All configuration management is handled using **GNU Stow**, allowing me to replicate this setup on any machine with just a few commands.
This repository is not actively maintained. Use with caution! Make a backup of your current setup before trying this out.

## Repository Structure

Each directory inside `dotfiles/` represents an independent module managed via `stow`.

For example:

dotfiles/
hypr/
kitty/
waybar/
nvim/
rofi/
fastfetch/
gtk/

Applying a module is as simple as running:
stow <module>

This structure keeps the setup modular, easy to maintain, and fully reproducible.
